Intended use

Primary intended uses:
** To predict whether or not the annual percentage rate (APR) charged for a mortgage is 150 basis points (1.5%) or more above a survey-based estimate of similar mortgages. (High-priced mortgages are legal, but somewhat punitive to borrowers. High-priced mortgages often fall on the shoulders of minority home owners, and are one of many issues that perpetuates a massive disparity in overall wealth between different demographic groups in the US.)
** The intended use is also to train an interpretable machine learning model, which is transparent and helps prevent biases.
Primary intended users: Students and academics interested in interpretable machine learning models.
Out-of-scope use cases: This is solely for educational purpose. Any use beyond an educational example is out-of-scope.
Describe the business value of your group's best remediated model

** The best remediated model is used for:
** Discrimination testing and attempt remediating of discovered discrimination using AIR (adverse impact ratio)
image
** Retrained the most accurate model above 0.8 AIR
** Best AUC: 0.7809 above 0.8 AIR (0.8116). Remediated EBM retrained with AUC: 0.7809.
** Checked that other groups are not adversely impacted y change: Adverse impact ratio for Asian people vs. White people: 1.146. Adverse impact ratio for Black people vs. White people: 0.812. Adverse impact ratio for Females vs. Males: 0.957 This analysis shows that even with a selective cutoff of 0.17, less discriminatory models are available. The new set of features and hyperparameters leads to a ~13% increase in AIR with a ~5% decrease in AUC.

Ethical considerations (2 pts.)
Describe potential negative impacts of using your group's best remediated model:
Consider math or software problems
Consider real-world risks: who, what, when and how?
** The model can improve accuracy but if there is bias in the data collection then it would lead to conflicting results.
** The model will become less useful if the economic conditions change dramatically. For example, if the model is built using pre-pandemic time period data, it would become less useful if we are trying to use the model during the pandemic.
Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your group's best remediated model:
Consider math or software problems
Consider real-world risks: who, what, when and how?
Describe any unexpected or results encountered during training
